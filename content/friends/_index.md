Thank you my friends! You’re like Wi-Fi for my soul—always there when I need you and annoyingly missed when you’re not.

[^1]: If unfortunately you are not listed here, please don't be sad, it's just because I am suffering from Puberzheimer’s[^2]. Feel free to ask me to add you here with your personal page! 😊

[^2]: Puberzheimer’s: Puberty + Alzheimer’s. A condition where you forget everything even during teenage years. 😂
