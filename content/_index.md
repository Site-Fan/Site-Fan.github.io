## Biography

I am a Senior Undergraduate at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](sustech.edu.cn) and a research intern in [Order Lab](https://orderlab.io/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/). 

Recently, I have been working on: 

- Implementing subgraph matching algorithms for dynamic graphs on GPU at HPC Lab.
- Continuous work of LiteSys, focusing on enhancing the availability and service continuity of datacenter software.

For more information, please refer to my [CV](./CV_Site_Fan.pdf).
