<strong>Seeking Ph.D. positions</strong>
<p>I am seeking Ph.D. positions beginning Fall 2026 in <strong>computer systems and high-performance computing</strong>, particularly in distributed and large-scale environments. My research interests center on designing scalable, reliable, and secure systems for compute- and data-intensive applications.</p>

## Bio

I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/) in June 2025.

My recent personal project focuses on designing high-performance algorithms for a Nurikabe solver, exploring optimization and search techniques for combinatorial problems. For more details about my projects and publications, please refer to my [CV](./CV_Site_Fan.pdf)
.

## Research

My primary research interests lie in the design and implementation of scalable, high-performance, and reliable computing systems. I am especially interested in high-performance computing (HPC), distributed systems, as well as infrastructure and runtime systems that support machine learning workloads. My work emphasizes performance optimization, system design, and robustness under realistic failure scenarios.

It has been a great honor to collaborate with faculty and researchers through research internships on topics including improving datacenter software availability ([Order Lab](https://orderlab.io/), with [Prof. Ryan Huang (University of Michigan)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/) and [Yi Chen](https://chenyi.world/)), designing secure operating system kernels (with [Prof. Yinqian Zhang](https://yinqian.org/)), and advancing evolutionary computation techniques (with [Prof. Ran Cheng](https://chengran.tech/)). I am now seeking Ph.D. opportunities to continue pursuing research in high-performance, reliable, and scalable system design.
