<strong>Seeking Ph.D. positions</strong>
<p>I am seeking Ph.D. positions beginning Fall 2026 in <strong>computer systems and high-performance computing</strong>, particularly in distributed and large-scale environments. My research interests center on designing scalable, reliable, and secure systems for compute- and data-intensive applications.</p>

## Bio

I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://sustech.edu.cn/en/) in July 2025.

My recent personal project focuses on **parallel bin packing optimization and scalable treemap visualization** for resource allocation in distributed systems. The work investigates heuristics with parallel acceleration to minimize fragmentation and energy consumption. For more details about my projects and publications, please refer to my [CV](./CV_Site_Fan.pdf)
.

## Research

My primary research interests lie in building scalable, high-performance, and reliable computing systems—especially in distributed systems and HPC. I also focus on machine learning systems for large models and trustworthy AI, studying how infrastructure, runtimes, and failure resilience shape model training/serving at scale. Across these areas, I emphasize performance optimization, system design, and robustness under realistic failure scenarios.

It has been a great honor to collaborate with faculty and researchers through research internships on topics including improving datacenter software availability ([Order Lab](https://orderlab.io/), with [Prof. Ryan Huang (University of Michigan)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/) and [Yi Chen](https://chenyi.world/)), designing secure operating system kernels (with [Prof. Yinqian Zhang](https://yinqian.org/)), and advancing evolutionary computation techniques (with [Prof. Ran Cheng](https://chengran.tech/)). I am now seeking Ph.D. opportunities to continue pursuing research in high-performance, reliable, and scalable system design.

## Misc

**How to pronounce my name *Site Fan*?**

My name is Site Fan (斯特 樊 in Chinese). By happy coincidence, my name is spelled with two common English words, so feel free to simply pronounce it like "Sight Fan."

However, if you want the "director's cut": In China, the family name comes first. If you say my name in the Chinese order (Fán Sī-tè) and speed it up a little, it sounds roughly like "Fanst"—which is exactly why I chose that for my domain name!
